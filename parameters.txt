                     add the parameter --variation, see below.
                     
-p PASSWORD          The password, on most pool it's used as a Worked ID for your miner.
                     If you don't know what to set, use "x".
                     
--auto or -c CONFIG  --auto sets an optimized configuration based on your CPU, its cache and the coin you mine.
                     -c CONFIG allows a manual fine tuning, with CONFIG being the path to the config file.
